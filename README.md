# Global population growth distribution data from 1970 to 2022

Data Analysis Findings:
- Globally, the fastest population growth and highest population density are observed in the Asian region. Considering highly populated countries like China, India, and Japan are located in Asia, this data aligns with expectations.
- A focused analysis of population growth distribution data in Australia reveals consistent growth from 1970 to 2022, with an approximate increase of 210%. The growth trend appears linear, indicating a stable increase in Australia's population without significant declines or surges.
- Data indicates a slight slowdown in Australia's population growth from 2020 to 2022, likely influenced by the global pandemic, which reduced population mobility. This suggests that a significant portion of Australia's population growth is driven by international migration, as the growth rate among native Australians remains moderate without regression.
- This dataset solely examines population growth in Australia. For a comprehensive analysis, additional statistics on job opportunities, housing availability, and per capita income in Australia from 1970 to 2022 are recommended. Integrating these datasets would facilitate a deeper understanding of whether population growth has positively impacted the country over the years. Moreover, it would shed light on whether the increasing population in Australia is accompanied by sufficient job opportunities and favorable living conditions.
